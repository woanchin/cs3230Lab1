I drew a wine bottle and two wine glasses because I am currently craving for
some alcohol.

I used scale to modify the sphere into a wine glass/cup shape. 
I did the appropriate transformation to fit each 3d object together.
I used a recursive method to form the stalk of the wine glass. 

I modified display and added in my own methods to create the relevant objects.

The coolest thing in my drawing is that there is actually wine in the wine glasses,
when my wine bottle is unopened! 

Both glasses and bottle are made of glass.
